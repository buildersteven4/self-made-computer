-- Instruction layout
[ opcode:6 | address A:5 | address B:5 | #:16 ]
opcode: Determines what operation to execute.
A: output and secondary input. The operation will be 8 or 16-bit corresponding to A.
B: primary input
#: The immidiate number, used in instructions that have mode A or B set to 1.

-- micro instructions
carry: Effects the output of the operations 0x5, 0x6 and 0x7. "carry" will be inverted if either "not A" or "not B" is set.
not A: Inverts bits of input A.
not B: Inverts bits of input B.
operation: Determines what operation's answer to output.
	0x0: pass A
	0x1: pass B
	0x2: shift left B
	0x3: shift right B
	0x4: or
	0x5: and
	0x6: exclusive or
	0x7: add
test: will update status flags
